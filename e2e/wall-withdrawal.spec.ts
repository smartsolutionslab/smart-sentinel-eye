/**
 * Spec 052 FR-011 — withdrawing one screen must not take down the wall.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Written for spec 050, gated when that attempt was withdrawn, and revived
 * here unchanged in substance.</b> The claim was always right; what was missing
 * was a client that offers the grant. It now runs against the wall-mode
 * instance and the dedicated wall client, ungated.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Originally: spec 050 US3 — withdrawing one screen must not take down the wall.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>This is the claim the research could only reason about.</b> R4 argued that
 * because the provider tracks offline sessions individually, one screen's grant
 * can be ended while a sibling keeps running. Reasoning is exactly what this
 * feature exists to distrust, so this tests it — and if it fails, US3 is
 * re-scoped in the open rather than reinterpreted into whatever the mechanism
 * happens to do.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It matters more here than it would elsewhere: the grant never expires, so
 * being able to end one is the only thing that ends it. If the unit of
 * withdrawal is the account rather than the session, withdrawing one screen
 * stops an entire fab's wall.
 * </p>
