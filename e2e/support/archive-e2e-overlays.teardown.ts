/**
 * Archives the overlays an e2e run publishes (spec 056).
 *
 * <para>
 * <b>Cameras and layouts were swept; overlays never were.</b> Each seeded run
 * publishes overlays that nothing archives — this feature's and SC-004's — so
 * the Published list grows by a few every run and never shrinks.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * <b>The scale of that is smaller than it first looked, and the first version of
 * this comment overstated it.</b> A long-lived dev database held 124 overlays of
 * which 111 were e2e-named, which reads like ninety per cent residue on the
 * page. It is not: <b>about a hundred were already Archived</b> — the
 * reconciliation spec archives the overlay it creates as part of what it tests —
 * so they were already out of the default listing. What actually accumulates is
 * the handful per run that are published and left that way.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * <b>Variables are deliberately not swept, because they cannot be.</b> The
 * product offers no way to delete a system variable: no control on the page, no
 * endpoint. 1618 of them have accumulated. Spec 056's FR-006 asks a fixture to
 * clean up what it creates, and for variables that is not currently possible —
 * recorded rather than quietly skipped.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * Same shape as the layout sweep: prefix-matched so it clears historical rows on
 * its first run, bounded by the clock rather than by attempts because the
 * residue is unbounded, and <b>best-effort</b> — a teardown that reddens a green
 * run over a tidy-up is one that gets deleted, and then nothing cleans up.
 * </para>
