 * It does <b>not</b> cover camera → SFU, SFU → decode, or the presentation

 * they enter this span by exactly one route: the label is held back to its
 * tile's own frame age, capped at 200 ms. So a figure from here is not the

 * request's own round trip is printed beside every sample so a reader can
 * subtract it instead of guessing at it.
 * </para>
 *
 * <para>
 * <b>The clock lives in the pages, not in this process.</b> Until spec 108 the
 * end was observed by `expect(label).toContainText(value)`, a polling assertion
 * whose interval backs off 100 / 250 / 500 / 1000 ms, and the start was stamped
 * in Node before a `fill` and a `click` — two round trips including
 * actionability checks. Both are the harness measuring itself, and together they
 * put the instrument's error at ~±1000 ms against an 800 ms budget. An
 * instrument whose error bar is larger than the thing it tests cannot say
 * whether the thing holds. So t0 is stamped by a capture-phase one-shot `click`
 * listener on the operator page, and t1 by a `MutationObserver` plus two chained
 * `requestAnimationFrame`s on the kiosk page — the product's own definition of

 * this subtraction would be meaningless</b>, which is what `sharesOneClock`
