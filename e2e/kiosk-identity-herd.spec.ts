 * Spec 051 US3 — screens coming back from one outage do not arrive together.

 * <p>
 * <b>The only story here that does not exist at a single screen.</b> One kiosk
 * retrying is harmless. Twenty in lockstep against a service that has just come
 * back are a self-inflicted second outage, and twenty is the constitution's
 * number.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Twenty are not exercised.</b> Four are, and what is demonstrated is the
 * spread rather than the scale. The verification note says so rather than
 * letting a green run here imply a wall was watched.
