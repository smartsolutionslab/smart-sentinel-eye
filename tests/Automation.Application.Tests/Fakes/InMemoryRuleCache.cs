/// The fab must be part of the key here exactly as it is in production. A

/// <c>RuleEvaluator</c>, which does no fab filtering of its own: a caller that
/// hard-codes the fab it looks up, or that falls back to some other fab when
/// the event carries none, simply misses the bucket and the absence-assertions
/// downstream stay green. The key the caller *asked for* is the one thing the
