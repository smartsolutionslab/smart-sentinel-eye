/// <para>
/// The gap is narrow and old. Specs 013, 018 and 021 hardened this context
/// repeatedly — who may read which plant's events, who may file one against
/// which plant, whether a revoked webhook integration still works — and every
/// one of those tests authenticates first. They answer "which fab may this
/// operator touch", never "must there be an operator at all". A regression that
/// dropped the authentication requirement would leave all of them green.

/// <para>
/// The write is the one that matters. An event filed into a plant's stream
/// drives that plant's automation rules and changes what its operators see —
/// the only path in the product by which one caller alters another plant's
/// state (spec 018). The read leaks; the write manipulates.

/// <b>401 rather than 403.</b> The distinction is the point of the test: no
