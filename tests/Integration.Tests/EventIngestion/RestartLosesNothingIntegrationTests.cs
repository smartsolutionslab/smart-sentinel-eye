/// <para>
/// The service is restarted through Aspire rather than killed outright, because
/// a project resource is a local process the fixture would not get back. The
/// substitution is honest here and only here: nothing is acknowledged before it
/// is stored, so a graceful stop and a crash leave the broker holding exactly
/// the same set. A real kill is walked by hand in the quickstart, and what it
/// showed is on the PR.

/// <b>Excluded from CI by its category.</b> It restarts a resource through
/// Aspire, and on the CI runner that command fails outright — "Failed to stop
/// resource". A test that goes red on a platform limitation rather than a code
/// defect teaches people to ignore red CI, which costs more than this test is
/// worth there. The cost of excluding it is real and stated: SC-002 has no CI
/// coverage, and is verified locally and by hand instead (verification.md §2).
