/// ungated <c>mediamtx</c> above already pulls". That argument is true only
/// while the references agree, and nothing but this test says so: three
/// independent literals four hundred lines apart drift silently, and the cost
/// of the drift is paid in every integration run rather than reported.

/// <b>No assertion here names a tag.</b> This is a characterisation test in the
/// ADR-0144 sense: it was observed green before spec 113 pinned the image and
/// must pass unmodified after, so it asserts the invariant (one reference across
/// all of them) rather than the value, which the pin moves from
/// <c>latest-ffmpeg</c> to a release. An assertion that had to be edited by the
/// change it guards is evidence the behaviour moved — and pinning to the digest
/// already running moves none.
