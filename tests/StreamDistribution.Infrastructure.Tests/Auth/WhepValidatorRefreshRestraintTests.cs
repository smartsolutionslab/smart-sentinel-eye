/// <summary>
/// Issue #2161, the restraint half. <see cref="WhepValidatorRotationTests"/>
/// says the hook must ask for a fresher discovery document when a fresher one
/// would cure the failure. These say it must not ask when nothing would.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the restraint is the load-bearing half.</b> The obvious fix — call
/// <c>RequestRefresh()</c> in the <c>catch</c>, on every failure — passes every
/// test in the rotation file. It also turns a token flood into a refresh storm
/// against Keycloak: an expired kiosk token replayed by a reconnect loop, or a
/// scanner spraying garbage at the MediaMTX hook, would drive a JWKS re-read on
/// the heels of every rejection. The five-minute <c>RefreshInterval</c> floor
/// throttles that to twelve reads an hour per instance rather than stopping it,
/// which is precisely why the floor is not a substitute for asking only when it
/// helps. <c>JwtBearerHandler</c> discriminates the same way: it requests a
/// refresh on signature-key-not-found, not on every rejected token.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Colours on arrival</b> (ADR-0139). All three are <b>GREEN</b>, and that is
/// correct: today the hook refreshes on nothing at all, so it trivially does not
/// refresh on these. They are written now because they are what stops the
/// rotation reds being paid for with a blanket refresh — they go <b>RED</b>
/// against exactly that implementation, which is the discrimination they exist
/// to make.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the assertion cannot pass vacuously.</b> It observes the stub
/// retriever's discovery-fetch count, not a mock's call log, so only a real
/// re-read moves it. Each test builds a fresh <see cref="ConfigurationManager{T}"/>
/// that has had no prior refresh request, and 8.19.2's <c>RequestRefresh()</c>
/// never throttles the <em>first</em> request on an instance — measured on this
/// harness, along with the throttling of the second inside the five-minute
/// window. So a blanket-refresh implementation would be refreshing on its
/// unthrottled first opportunity, and the count would move. The second
/// <c>ValidateAsync</c> is what makes it observable at all: <c>RequestRefresh()</c>
/// only marks the cache due, and the fetch happens on the next
/// <c>GetConfigurationAsync</c>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>The settle window.</b> 8.19.2 performs a due refresh on a background task,
/// so a count read immediately after the second call would read one whether or
/// not a refresh was requested — a vacuous green. <see cref="FetchesAfterSettlingAsync"/>
/// waits for the count to move, up to a bounded window, and only then reads it:
/// re-reading two in-memory documents takes milliseconds, so a window in seconds
/// is decisive.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>A known limit, stated rather than left implied.</b> One failure that a
/// fresher document <em>could</em> in principle cure is deliberately not
/// refreshed on and is <b>not covered by any test here</b>: a rotation that
/// reuses its <c>kid</c>, which raises
/// <c>SecurityTokenInvalidSignatureException</c> (IDX10511). There the key
/// resolved and only the signature did not match, so the document the hook holds
/// is the one the realm published. Keycloak issues a new <c>kid</c> on rotation,
/// which is why this is a limit and not a defect — but it is a limit, and the
/// evidence for the discriminator stops short of it (#2161).
