/// <para>
/// <b>What is broken.</b> <c>WhepAuthValidator</c> reads issuer and signing keys
/// from a <see cref="ConfigurationManager{T}"/> whose
/// <c>AutomaticRefreshInterval</c> is twelve hours. <c>JwtBearerHandler</c> —
/// the pipeline the nine REST APIs sit behind — calls <c>RequestRefresh()</c>
/// when a token fails with signature-key-not-found, so those APIs re-read JWKS
/// inside the five-minute throttle floor. This hook never calls it. After
/// Keycloak rotates, every management page recovers within five minutes and the
/// wall keeps 401ing until the twelve-hour timer expires.

/// still the pre-rotation one on every later call.
/// <see cref="A_token_signed_with_the_superseded_key_is_refused_once_the_rotation_has_landed"/>
/// is <b>GREEN</b>, and drives the rotation by calling <c>RequestRefresh()</c> on
/// the manager itself rather than through the validator — so it is a control that
/// proves the harness really rotates, not a second copy of the red. The restraint
/// half of #2161 — the failures a refresh cannot cure — lives in
/// <see cref="WhepValidatorRefreshRestraintTests"/>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Two key identifiers, deliberately.</b> The rotated key carries a
/// <c>kid</c> of its own, in the JWKS and in the token header, because that is
/// what Keycloak rotation does and it is what makes the failure
/// <c>SecurityTokenSignatureKeyNotFoundException</c> (IDX10503) — the "a fresher
/// document could cure this" condition. Reusing key A's <c>kid</c> would resolve
/// the key and fail with <c>SecurityTokenInvalidSignatureException</c> (IDX10511)
/// instead, which is a different condition and must <em>not</em> provoke a
/// refresh. Both were put through the real handler before these tests were
/// written. The issuer case keeps the key and its <c>kid</c> unchanged and moves
/// only <c>iss</c>, so it fails with
/// <c>SecurityTokenInvalidIssuerException</c> (IDX10205) and nothing else.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why acceptance is awaited rather than asserted on the literal second
/// call.</b> Microsoft.IdentityModel 8.19.2's <c>GetConfigurationAsync</c>
/// performs a due refresh on a <em>background</em> task and hands the caller that
/// triggered it the stale document. Measured on this harness: after an explicit
/// <c>RequestRefresh()</c> the second and third calls still returned the
/// pre-rotation document, and the fetch count only moved once the background task
/// had run. <see cref="ValidateUntilAcceptedAsync"/> therefore polls within a
/// bounded window instead of sleeping for a guessed interval. The poll cannot buy
/// a green on its own: with no refresh requested the manager's next sync is
/// twelve hours out, so repeated calls return the cached document and never
/// re-enter the retriever — also measured.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Neither refresh interval is touched.</b> Setting
/// <c>AutomaticRefreshInterval</c> or <c>RefreshInterval</c> would make these
/// pass against the unfixed validator, which is exactly the false green #2161

/// validator through the #2099 internal seam, a real
/// <see cref="ConfigurationManager{T}"/> over an in-memory
