/// Spec 089 / issue #2095 — the WHEP hook takes its issuer from the realm's
/// discovery document, not from the URL it dials the realm on.
///
/// <para>
/// <b>What is broken.</b> <c>WhepAuthValidator.CreateParameters</c> sets
/// <c>ValidIssuer</c> to the configured authority — the URL the service dials
/// Keycloak on, derived from <c>ConnectionStrings:keycloak</c>. The bearer
/// pipeline sets neither <c>ValidIssuer</c> nor <c>ValidIssuers</c> and lets
/// <c>JwtBearerHandler</c> fill them, per request, from the discovery
/// document's <c>issuer</c>. The two strings are equal only while Keycloak's
/// <c>iss</c> equals the URL it is reached on. Behind an ingress
/// (<c>KC_HOSTNAME=https://keycloak.fab.example</c>, connection string
/// <c>http://keycloak:8080</c>) they are not, and every WHEP open 401s — the
/// whole wall goes dark while every management page still loads.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why the fix must move the issuer rather than widen it.</b>
/// <c>JwtBearerHandler</c> <em>concatenates</em> the discovery issuer onto
/// whatever <c>ValidIssuers</c> already holds, and because the bearer side
/// starts null, the nine REST APIs today accept <em>exactly one</em> issuer.
/// Keeping the dialled URL alongside the discovery issuer would make this hook
/// <b>more</b> permissive than the nine APIs — the inverse of spec 071's rule.
/// <see cref="A_token_carrying_the_dialled_url_as_its_issuer_is_refused"/> is
/// what pins that, and it also fails if anyone reaches parity by setting
/// <c>ValidateIssuer = false</c>.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Colours on arrival, stated rather than left to be inferred</b>
/// (ADR-0139). Two of the three cases below are <b>RED</b> on
/// <c>develop</c>: the ingress acceptance, and the dialled-URL refusal — the
/// latter because <c>ValidIssuer</c> <em>is</em> the dialled URL today, so a
/// token carrying it is accepted. plan.md predicted that second case green;
/// it is not, and the correction is recorded here rather than in the file it
/// would have to be re-derived from.
/// <see cref="A_token_carrying_an_unrelated_issuer_is_refused"/> is the only
/// one green on arrival, and it is green for the wrong reason — that issuer is
/// neither string, so it fails whichever of the two the hook is comparing
/// against. It is the control that stops the acceptance case from being bought
/// by validating nothing.
/// </para>
///
/// <para>
/// <b>Why this is a unit test and not an Aspire-fixture one</b> (ADR-0103).
/// The fixture reaches Keycloak through the Aspire proxy and the realm's
/// <c>iss</c> is that same proxied endpoint by construction — that is the
/// recorded "Keycloak issuer must match the proxied port" trap. There is no
/// token in that stack whose <c>iss</c> differs from the dialled URL, and
/// provoking one means setting <c>KC_HOSTNAME</c> in <c>AppHost</c>, which
/// every test in <c>AspireCollection</c> shares and which would break token
/// minting for all of them. The divergence is two string constants here.
