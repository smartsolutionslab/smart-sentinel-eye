/// need to: every context with a user-facing uniqueness rule already answers
/// specifically — <c>CAMERA_NAME_TAKEN</c>, <c>RULE_NAME_TAKEN</c>,
/// <c>VARIABLE_NAME_TAKEN</c> and the rest — and those fire on the common path.
/// This one is what a caller sees only when such a check was told the name was
/// free and lost the race before its write landed. Those checks stay; this is a
