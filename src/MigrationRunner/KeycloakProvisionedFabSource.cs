/// <c>/fabs</c> and its children are imported with the realm, from the same
/// document as the <c>migration-runner</c> client whose token this call needs,
/// and Keycloak binds its HTTP listener only after that import has finished —
/// so a caller that can reach the admin API at all is talking to a realm whose
/// groups are already there. Nothing creates a fab group at runtime either.
/// An empty tree is therefore a verdict, not a "not yet".
