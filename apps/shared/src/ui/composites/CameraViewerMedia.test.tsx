/**
 * Spec 094 / issue #2111 — **a tile says Live when a picture has arrived**,
 * not when a socket came up.
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Four reds and three guards, and they are not the same thing.</b> R1–R4
 * fail on the code as it stands; they are the ADR-0139 evidence. G1–G3 pass
 * today and are expected to keep passing — they pin the behaviour the change
 * must not break, and counting them as red would be the shortcut ADR-0139
 * exists to prevent.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>R4 arrived at phase 6</b>, with the review finding that `totalVideoFrames`
 * is per element and not per session: it is red on the code as it stands
 * <i>and</i> on the first cut of the fix, which tested the counter against zero.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>Why a new file.</b> `CameraViewer.test.tsx` is the characterisation of the
 * transport ladder and stays byte-identical (NFR-003) — the strongest form that
 * claim can take. This file adds the media dimension beside it, the shape
 * `CameraViewerAlignment.test.tsx` already set.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The existing suite currently asserts the defect, and that is worth saying
 * out loud.</b> `ontrack` appears exactly once in `CameraViewer.test.tsx` — a
 * field declaration on the fake at `:18` — and is never fired. So every one of
 * its tests that reaches `connected` does so with no track ever delivered, and
 * asserts Live. Those tests are not wrong; they were written about the
 * transport ladder. But "the suite is green" has never been evidence about
 * whether a picture arrived, which is why the instrument below has to be
 * supplied rather than reused.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <b>The instrument is `getVideoPlaybackQuality().totalVideoFrames`</b>, read
 * off the tile's own element — decided in spec 077 §3, which cites #2111 by
 * number, and already in use at `e2e/click-to-first-frame.spec.ts:286`. Not
 * `framesDecoded`: `CameraViewer`'s sampler for it is gated on
 * `status === 'live'` (`CameraViewer.tsx:113`), so under any design where Live
 * means media the signal deciding the gate is switched on by the gate.
 * </p>
